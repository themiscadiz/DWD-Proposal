# DWD Proposal for Final Project

## Description
For my final project I want to work in a voting system where the user can vote they favorite pet from four options. Some of the things that I intend to apply is to get multiple options for voting, open a window for confirm vote, visualize in a graph the amoutn of vote per animal and have persisten data.
## Goals
In this project my goal is to apply this concepts:
* html/css/js
* Responsive design
* Node.js 
* Persisten data
* Run a p5 sketch (for the graph visualization)

### Wireframes
So far, I designed a wireframe to have a better guidence during the development.
