# DWD Proposal for Final Project

## Description
For my final project I want to work in a voting system where the user can vote for their favorite pet from several options. Some of the things that I intend to apply:
* is to get multiple options for voting, 
* open a window to confirm vote, 
* visualize in a graph the amount of votes per animal 
* use a database for persisten data.

## Goals
In this project my goal is to apply:
* html/css/js
* Responsive design
* Node.js 
* Persisten data
* Run a p5 sketch (for the graph visualization)

### Wireframes
So far, I designed a wireframe to have a better guidence during the development.
